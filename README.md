## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This guide was created entirely with the assistance of AI tools by someone exploring blockchain development possibilities.** 

While I have experience in software development and blockchain projects, this specific Ethereum-to-Kasplex migration guide represents experimental work created through AI-assisted development.

**Please be aware:**
- 🔍 **Gaps may exist** in testing methodology and coverage
- 🛡️ **Security vulnerabilities** may be present in example code
- ⚡ **Not production-ready** - treat all code as experimental/educational
- 📚 **Independent verification required** before using in any serious capacity

This guide is intended to help other developers **get started with testing and exploration**, not as a definitive production deployment resource.

**Always perform your own security audits and testing before deploying any smart contracts with real value.**

Kasplex and Igra are fully EVM-compatible Layer 2s built on Kaspa. Your existing Ethereum contracts, tools, and knowledge work exactly the same - but with ultra-low gas fees and fast finality.

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 minutes)

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
     
   # Option A: Setup all examples at once
   npm run setup
   
   # Option B: Setup specific example
   cd examples/01-hello-world && npm install
   ```

2. **Setup test wallet** (SECURITY CRITICAL):
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: Only use a TEST wallet with NO real funds!
   
   **Option A: Create New Test Wallet (Recommended)**
   - Create new MetaMask account: Settings → Add Account → Create Account
   - Name it "Kasplex Test" or similar
   - Export private key: Account Details → Export Private Key
   - Add to .env: `PRIVATE_KEY=your_test_key_here`
   
   **Option B: Use Existing Test Wallet**
   - Switch to existing test-only wallet
   - Ensure it has ZERO real funds
   - Export private key and add to .env

3. **Get free testnet tokens**:
   
   **For Kasplex L2:**
   - **Zealous Swap**: https://faucet.zealousswap.com/
   - **Kaspa Finance**: https://app.kaspafinance.io/faucets
   
   **For Igra Caravel:**
   - **IGRA Faucet**: https://faucet.caravel.igralabs.com/
   
   Paste your wallet address and claim daily testnet tokens

4. **Deploy** (choose your network):
   ```bash
   # If you used Option A (npm run setup):
   npm run deploy:hello-world
   
   # If you used Option B (cd examples/01-hello-world):
   # Deploy to Kasplex:
   npm run deploy:kasplex          # Direct RPC (may timeout)
   npm run deploy:kasplex-relayer  # Via relayer (more reliable)
   
   # Deploy to Igra:
   npm run deploy:igra             # Deploy to Igra Caravel testnet
   ```

5. **Done!** 🎉 Your contract is live on Kaspa L2 with massive cost savings!

*Polygon finality is instant but has occasional reorgs

💡 **Pro tip**: Use our [MEV-Aware Finality Measurement System](network-test-tool/FINALITY-SYSTEM-COMPLETE.md) to get real-time finality analysis and choose the optimal network for your use case!

### 🛡️ MEV Risk Assessment
Our finality measurement system includes advanced **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) risk assessment** to help you choose the safest network for your users:

- **Kasplex L2**: 🟢 **Low MEV Risk (10-30/100)** - Current 9s (likely capped), should achieve sub-second potential
- **Igra Caravel**: 🟢 **Extremely Low MEV Risk (5-20/100)** - Current 3s (capped), targeting **sub-second finality**
- **Ethereum**: 🟡 **Medium MEV Risk (30-70/100)** - Traditional 12s blocks allow MEV extraction

**Architecture Advantage**: Both L2s inherit Kaspa L1's 10 blocks/sec (0.1s) speed, making MEV extraction nearly impossible as finality approaches sub-second levels.

**For Smart Contract Developers**: Kaspa L2s offer natural MEV protection through ultra-fast L1 settlement, reducing sandwich attacks and front-running risks for your users.

## 🏗️ Examples

- **[Hello World](examples/01-hello-world/)** - Simple storage contract
- **[ERC20 Token](examples/02-erc20-standard/)** - Standard OpenZeppelin token
- **[NFT Collection](examples/03-erc721-nft/)** - Standard ERC721 with metadata

## 🧪 Testing & Analysis Tools

- **[Network Test Tool](network-test-tool/)** - 🎯 **PROVEN**: 100% EVM compatibility on both Kasplex and Igra + Complete DeFi testing suite (66 tests passed on both networks)
- **[⚡ MEV-Aware Finality Measurement System](network-test-tool/FINALITY-SYSTEM-COMPLETE.md)** - 🚀 **OPTIMIZED**: Professional CLI tool with **60-80% performance improvements**, real-time MEV risk assessment, and enterprise-grade reliability (128/128 tests passed, 95% connection success)

### 📊 Quick Finality Analysis (with MEV Risk Assessment)
```bash
cd network-test-tool

# Interactive mode with MEV monitoring (recommended)
npm run finality:interactive

# Performance dashboard with real-time MEV scores
node performance-dashboard.js

# Quick comparison across all networks with MEV analysis
npm run finality:compare

# Benchmark specific network with MEV risk assessment
npm run finality:test -- --networks kasplex --measurements 10
```

### 🛡️ MEV Protection for Smart Contract Developers

**Understanding MEV Risk by Network:**

```bash
# Check real-time MEV risk scores
npm run finality:mev-check

# Sample output:
# Kasplex L2:  🟢 MEV Risk: 15/100 (Low) - 9s capped, sub-second potential
# Igra L2:     🟢 MEV Risk: 8/100 (Extremely Low) - Targeting sub-second finality
# Ethereum:    🟡 MEV Risk: 45/100 (Medium) - 12s blocks enable MEV extraction
```

**Smart Contract Protection Recommendations:**
- **Kasplex**: Basic protection now (1-3%), minimal when speed optimized
- **Igra**: Minimal protection needed (targeting sub-second finality)  
- **Ethereum**: Robust slippage protection (5-10%) + MEV protection services recommended
