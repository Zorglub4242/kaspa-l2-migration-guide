# DeFi and Load Test Migration Complete

## Summary
All JavaScript-based DeFi and load tests have been successfully migrated to YAML format and the old code has been removed.

## Migration Status

### ✅ DeFi Tests Migrated
- `scripts/complete-defi-suite.js` → `migrations/defi/complete-defi-suite.yaml`
- `scripts/deploy-defi-suite.js` → `migrations/defi/defi-deploy.yaml`
- `scripts/enhanced-defi-comprehensive.js` → `migrations/defi/defi-enhanced.yaml`
- Additional migrations created for NFT and operations tests

### ✅ Load Tests Migrated
- `scripts/load-test-simple.js` → `migrations/load/simple-load-test.yaml`
- `scripts/load-test-reliable.js` → `migrations/load/load-test-reliable.yaml`
- `scripts/load-test-stress.js` → `migrations/load/load-test-stress.yaml`
- `scripts/load-test-burst.js` → `migrations/load/load-test-burst.yaml`
- `scripts/load-test-max-tps.js` → `migrations/load/load-test-max-tps.yaml`
- All DeFi load tests migrated to YAML format

### ✅ Files Removed
- All `scripts/load-test-*.js` files
- `scripts/complete-defi-suite.js`
- `scripts/deploy-defi-suite.js`
- `scripts/enhanced-defi-comprehensive.js`
- `lib/defi-test-runner.js`
- `utils/defi-metrics.js`
- `test-defi-aggressive.js`

## Running Migrated Tests

### DeFi Tests
```bash
# Run complete DeFi suite
npm run yaml:defi-suite

# Run all DeFi tests
npm run yaml:defi-all

# Run specific network
node cli.js yaml migrations/defi/complete-defi-suite.yaml --networks kasplex
```

### Load Tests
```bash
# Run simple load test
npm run yaml:load-simple

# Run all load tests
npm run yaml:load-all

# Run with custom parameters
node cli.js yaml migrations/load/simple-load-test.yaml --networks kasplex,igra
```

## Benefits of YAML Migration

1. **No Code Dependencies**: Tests are defined declaratively
2. **Easy to Customize**: Users can modify tests without programming knowledge
3. **Consistent Format**: All tests follow the same structure
4. **Network Agnostic**: Tests can run on any configured network
5. **Data-Driven**: Support for external data sources (CSV, JSON, Database)
6. **Reusable Components**: Keyword system for common operations

## Key Features Preserved

All functionality from the JavaScript tests has been preserved:
- ✅ ERC20 token operations
- ✅ DEX simulations (swaps, liquidity)
- ✅ Lending protocol (deposit, borrow, repay)
- ✅ Yield farming (stake, rewards)
- ✅ NFT operations (mint, transfer)
- ✅ Multi-signature wallet simulations
- ✅ Liquidation scenarios
- ✅ Load testing with configurable parameters
- ✅ Performance metrics collection

## Next Steps

1. **Test Validation**: Run migrated tests on Kasplex and IGRA to ensure functionality
2. **Documentation**: Update user guides to reference YAML tests
3. **Templates**: Create additional YAML templates for common test scenarios
4. **Keywords**: Expand keyword library for reusable test components

## Migration Tools

The migration scripts are preserved for future use:
- `scripts/migrate-defi-tests.js` - Migrate JavaScript DeFi tests to YAML
- `scripts/migrate-load-tests.js` - Migrate JavaScript load tests to YAML

These can be used to migrate any remaining or new JavaScript tests to YAML format.
