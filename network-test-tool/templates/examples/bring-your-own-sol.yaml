# Simplest Example: Bring Your Own .sol Contract
# Just point to your Solidity file and start testing!

test: My Solidity Contract Test
description: Testing my own Solidity smart contract
network: kasplex

setup:
  accounts:
    alice: 10 ETH
    bob: 10 ETH

  contracts:
    # Just provide your .sol file path!
    # The tool compiles it automatically
    myContract:
      type: Solidity
      source: ./MyContract.sol  # Your .sol file
      args: []  # Constructor arguments if any
      from: alice

scenario:
  # Now you can test your contract!
  - call:
      contract: myContract
      method: setValue
      args: [42]
      from: alice

  - call:
      contract: myContract
      method: getValue
      expect: 42

  - transfer: alice -> myContract, 1 ETH

  - check: "myContract.balance == 1 ETH"
