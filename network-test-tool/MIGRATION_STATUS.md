# Test Migration Status

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Network-Agnostic Design
- Removed hardcoded `network:` fields from all YAML tests
- Made network field optional in yaml-schema.json
- Tests now accept network as CLI parameter (`-n` flag)

### 2. Directory Structure Created
```
test-scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ basic/          # Simple transfer and wallet tests
â”œâ”€â”€ defi/           # DeFi protocol tests
â”œâ”€â”€ load/           # Load and performance tests
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/      # Contract deployment tests
â”œâ”€â”€ evm/           # EVM compatibility tests
â””â”€â”€ advanced/       # Advanced features (parallel, conditional, etc.)
```

### 3. Successfully Migrated Tests

#### Basic (3/3) - 100% PASSING
- simple-transfer.yaml âœ…
- funded-transfers.yaml âœ…
- wallet-operations.yaml âœ…

#### DeFi (4/10) - In Progress
- migration-simple.yaml âœ…
- simple.yaml âœ…
- simple-comprehensive.yaml (migrated, testing)
- comprehensive-basic.yaml (migrated, testing)

#### Load Tests (11/11) - Migrated
- simple.yaml
- basic.yaml
- reliable.yaml
- stress.yaml
- burst.yaml
- max-tps.yaml
- diagnostic.yaml
- compare.yaml
- (3 more migrated)

#### Advanced Tests (3/5) - Migrated
- wallet-ops.yaml
- parallel.yaml
- conditional.yaml

### 4. Interactive CLI
- âœ… Created `interactive-cli.js`
- Features:
  - Dynamic test discovery from test-scripts/
  - Dynamic network loading from config/networks/
  - Multiple run modes (single, category, network, multi-network)
  - Test listing and network listing
  - Progress tracking and results summary

### 5. Execution Fixes
- Added 2-second delay for Igra network to prevent orphan transactions
- Simplified log messages to avoid parser issues
- Fixed gas price handling for network-specific requirements

## ðŸ”§ Known Issues

### 1. Log Parser
- Complex log messages with special characters fail
- Solution: Use simple log messages without colons or hyphens

### 2. Igra Network
- Requires 2-second delay between transactions to prevent orphan errors
- Fix implemented in account-actions.js

### 3. Contract Tests
- Tests with contract deployments fail on Igra
- These tests need separate handling or network-specific configurations

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Work

1. **Complete DeFi test migration** (6 more files)
2. **Fix validation issues** in migrated Load tests
3. **Migrate Contract tests** (if applicable)
4. **Test all migrated files** on Igra to 100% pass rate
5. **Delete old test locations** after full migration

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Run Interactive CLI
```bash
node interactive-cli.js
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
node cli.js yaml test-scripts/basic/simple-transfer.yaml -n igra
```

### Run Category Tests
```bash
# All basic tests on Igra
for file in test-scripts/basic/*.yaml; do
  node cli.js yaml "$file" -n igra
done
```

## ðŸ“Š Migration Statistics

- **Total Tests Identified**: 41
- **Tests Migrated**: 21
- **Tests Passing**: 5+ (testing in progress)
- **Networks Available**: 13
- **Categories**: 6

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Complete testing of migrated DeFi tests
2. Fix any remaining execution issues
3. Migrate remaining contract and EVM tests
4. Achieve 100% pass rate on Igra network
5. Clean up old test locations
6. Document any network-specific requirements
